# 10000Hours
There is a theory that to become a master in something you must spend for it at least 10 000 hours. So I made simple Python program with GUI using PyQt5 to count time one spend on some exercises. When you start exercising you start timer, and stop it when you finish. The programm will remember time you have exercised so far. Also you can add some notes for every exercise you do.
